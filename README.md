Hi everyone!
Recently i've read a palindrome which is very funny. Able was i ere i saw elba. It has sense to it; Napoleon was imprisoned on the isle of Elba, see? He was able, before he was imprisoned there. If you read the sentence backwards, it says exactly the same thing, which is called a Palindrome.
